Collision with RW Set
====

## What kind of State could exist

## Collision with Read

### No-collision - WeakRead

* When the change of read value does not affect the control's action
  * Just not so critical - Any value would be OK
  * Even the value is changed, the result could be fixed by its existence

### Collision - Read

* The control's action is strongly dependent on the changed value

## R


## Issues

### Really can I allows that OverWrite overwrites every JustWrite always?
