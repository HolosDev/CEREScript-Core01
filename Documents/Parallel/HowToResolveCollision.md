How to resolve collision
====

## Cases

## Methods

### Method #1

Re-calculate spools/events when occurs collision.
This is a complete method, but too hard to run.

### Method #2

Completely avoid collisions before running events by preprocessing.
This is not so hard when the script have no repeat/loop or branch structure.
But when there is unpredictable work flow,

#### Fine cutting avoidance

Desirable method, but requires more processing

#### Rough cutting avoidance

Not so good. But implement is easy.
However, this may not allowed.
